# My Voice managed integration (in progress)

User authorizes source/release/install on both PCs. Isolated worktree based on
59ea61d main; no changes to the unborn outer aggregate or other app worktrees.
New app source I:/Projects/my-voice; detailed handoff there. No agents/Actions.

Voice registry optional Creative, /voice, rebased+38, foundation OIDC, private
storage/runtime/recovery scope, update owner/group/capability and sign-out/shared
navigation added. Installer integration7 and target111. Standard managed-seed
builder now needs a public myVoice pin and strict voice_component.py contract;
do not invent pins. README/directory/SVG/PNG/ICO overview regenerated. Four unrelated
generated Finance/Authenticator binary exports changed during sync and should be
restored from this task's clean base before staging. Android category adds Voice,
version12; mandatory signed-Android publication entry point must be used.

catalog/distribution/suite/branding/apphost checks pass after GOTMPDIR is moved to
synthetic NTFS C root. Go1.27 testing.TempDir follows GOTMPDIR, unlike earlier
assumptions that setting TEMP/TMP was sufficient. Earlier distribution timing
test failed under concurrent compile load and passed serial/NTFS rerun. Voice
storage profile missing on first run was corrected, not waived.

No source push, app/suite publication, public channel promotion or owner install
yet. Pending: public tested app pin, ordinary complete catalog build and omission
gate, actual isolated installer fresh/upgrade/rollback, native Accounts/Drive/TTS,
final exact source tests, signed Android12 suite111, public/anonymous verification
and protected install receipts on primary and secondary. Primary actual110 at
C:/tmp/workspace/Private (35 apps); existing public110/managedSeed103 retained.
New installer handoff can use normal Back up and reinstall Workspace when
integration6 cannot interpret7. Never bypass journal or patch installed catalog.


## 3 November native gates and managed-candidate checkpoint

No commits/push/releases/channel promotion/owner Voice installation yet. New public
main e465a8a was fast-forwarded into suite worktree: preserve MyAI20 lock/channel
and both PCs' independently installed MyAI20. The public110 full bundle embeds
MyAI14/Social6; existing repair/update code preserves newer installed app bytes.
Secondary baseline110/MyAI20/Hosting2, pre-existing MyMeet3 “Review release” warning.

MOSS now uses only explicit locally saved state or the CC0 Open Voice preset,
reference pinned to kyutai/tts-voices323332d.../voice-donations/0a67.wav. No upstream
named demo state is offered. MOSS install verifies that reference then prepares
preset-state.json. Language metadata/filter added. Models validate marker version
and asset presence/size; gated Pocket cloning remains absent.

Native minimal FFmpeg succeeded:3,202,048 byte executable,1,510,883 byte ZIP.
FFmpeg1e65c6cd + LAME3.100, LGPL source/recipe/notices retained. Runtime ZIP now
54,349,265 bytes, not107MB. runtime.lock points to intended future immutable own
release ffmpeg-runtime.zip; MUST publish that asset and complete source ZIP before
calling source reconstruction public-ready. prepare-runtime.py succeeded. Raw
upstream MOSS runtime digest99477efa... differs from Windows CRLF checkout digest;
lock corrected to raw unmodified upstream bytes. A cp1252 UI insertion was repaired.

Restart caught a real migration-order bug: SDK Migrate(1) rejected schema2 at
second launch. New startup reads current version, applies only pending migrations,
rejects newer schema. Regression covers1→2/restart/preserved project/future reject.
Native actual process restart now preserves clone, audio SHA, draft controls and
resumes interrupted segments with exact completed byte reuse. Windows test harness
PIPE output was inherited by background processes, causing an EOF wait despite
successful restart; use file stdout/stderr and bounded process wait, not PIPE.
restart-only.py passes. MP3/M4A/WebM state creation/deletion, WAV/silence validation,
speed/pitch extremes, dictionaries/dialogue/regeneration/long text/batch/cancel,
sharing/revoke, permissions, desktop/phone UI pass. TryLock rejects concurrent
reference preparation before audio read; replacement expansion bounded in API/UI.
Empty existing draft autosave corrected; final UI production build passes.

All9 CPU benchmark cases complete, two threads. Pocket18:13.012s audio/2.280s wall,
92.055/16.253 long,~464MiB peak tree. Pocket7:13.252/2.255,87.255/14.888 long,
~254MiB. MOSS:28.444/39.170,13.328/22.689 second request,146.809/292.786 long,
~1.7GiB. No network first-audio exposure; playback after assembly; no low-end,
physical-mic/phone, human blind listening or quality-superiority claim. Exact
candidate benchmark SHA/runtime provenance retained privately and sanitized in
app docs/evidence/windows-native.json. Startup to health existing data~1.6s.

Latest app binary tooling/my-voice-20261102/MyVoice-candidate-final.exe includes
all source fixes; MyVoice-ship.exe is running fixture (diff only empty-draft UI fix).
Candidate package voice-candidate.zip created with complete notices/docs and
manifest sourceCommit=unpublished-candidate. TEST-REPORT-WINDOWS.md explicitly
marks managed/publication/owner delivery pending. No real user audio in repo.

Important: suite organization-components.lock.json myVoice currently contains a
LOCAL FUTURE candidate pin. Do not commit/push it until public asset verified.
Added local-only --voice-candidate / -MyVoiceCandidate through ordinary rebuild
path; managed-build.candidate=true makes publisher reject such outputs. This allows
actual managed OIDC/Drive/fresh/upgrade/rollback acceptance BEFORE app release.
Final normal rebuild must use verified public pin without candidate flag. Voice
catalog port corrected9028 (base+38), standalone9038 remains separate. Android12
now includes generated brand_my_voice.png. Four unrelated generated exports restored.

First candidate rebuild rejected a partial old seed cache348MB, correctly.
Official public103 expected1,215,056,385 bytes, pinned cc61e4bf...; full anonymous
download session68040 underway to suite-cache/*.download, then SHA verified/rename.
Old invalid copy retained *.invalid-cached, original other-task cache untouched.
Rerun scripts/rebuild.ps1 -MyVoiceCandidate ...voice-candidate.zip with cache/out
under tooling root. Candidate builder uses public baseline103 + public remote10,
Tickets1, Authenticator2, Accounts, Hosting2; add Voice. Final complete inventory36.
Next actual synthetic setup select/omit Voice (Accounts/Drive/Voice), real SSO and
Drive export/import, protected public110→111 upgrade/rollback/reapply. Retain exact
unselected bytes/identity/paths. Then app source+annotatedtag/release (all hashes,
corresponding sources/runtime ZIP), replace local pin with public digest, normal
rebuild, mandatory signed Android publisher111/channel, primary normal new-installer
protected update and secondary owner Updates repair→optional Voice selection.

CUA Chrome3 initialized, documentation rewritten. New ephemeral task tab585734847
voiceRolloutTab currently secondary /updates, authenticated; voiceSecondaryBaseline
stores34 table rows for later comparison. MyMeet review warning pre-existed.
Original HF blocked-download tab still task-modified; restore original model tree
only if still that blocked page, avoid user work. No owner model download/consent
has been performed. Models remain explicit first-use owner installation.


## Later checkpoint: managed acceptance, optional upgrade repair, lazy CPU runtime

Fresh candidate actual installer passes Accounts OIDC/owner binding/anonymous deny,
shared Apps picker, managed Pocket download+CPU WAV/MP3, exact My Drive export and
Markdown import, global logout. Extended managed test also installs open MOSS,
creates CC0 clone, synthesizes distinct text and deletes its state in the nested
restricted worker. managed-acceptance.json passes; all fixture services stopped.
Initial Apps/Drive waits were test locator assumptions (manager converts Apps link
to button; success contains destination), not app defects. Omission also passes:
no Voice executable/runtime/contract/docs/private data. Suite intentionally keeps
all legal licence notices globally; do not assert those are absent.

Actual public110 controller rejects incoming integration7 before config mutation.
New111 candidate then exposed platform gap: optional new apps were never offered
by markNewDefaults/WantedApps, so explicit voice selection said unavailable.
Fixed distribution UpdateChoice.Optional, new optional-group discovery respecting
explicit exclusions/dependency exclusions; optional groups never auto-selected by
CLI, Workspace default addition or startup bridge. Maintenance UI leaves optional
checkbox unchecked and enabled alongside Workspace, with explicit hint. Source
helper renamed markNewApps. Existing coupled-group selections are preserved.
New regression covers explicit Voice/namespace/rebased port, default omission and
opt-out retention. distribution/maintenance/catalog/suite/branding all now pass.
Corrected test-only expected29028→29038; actual catalog Voice port9028/base+38.

Cold benchmark found unused MOSS runtime verification on Pocket first request
(~25.5s). App runtimeFor(false) now prepares/verifies only Pocket+FFmpeg; MOSS calls
runtimeFor(true), cached separately. Exact final app binary now MyVoice-lazy-candidate.exe
SHA0913a566d5267060cb485d8554f49ccccdb952e82c7ab6677ccb7f75c91f1f87.
Payload SHA87996d2929a2db9f3aee664e7b769a473315638de1426592bc6b58c9ef93c76e unchanged.
Fresh-runtime native proof confirms no moss/ directory after Pocket; explicit MOSS
then prepares verified Python and synthesizes (4.1555s audio,19.969s first-use wall).
Native Pocket final workloads329 chars/~19s and1963 chars/~2min now measured:
18M cold19s/4.621s; long22.174s;7M long119.129s/20.002s. Full results in
benchmarks-pocket-final.json; before-lazy evidence retained separately. Need update
public report/evidence to final metrics. Phone library/settings overflow checks pass.
Private4s CC0 sample open-moss-sample.mp3 shown to user for listening, no superiority claim.

New source scripts/package-windows.py whitelists docs/licences+tested EXE, writes
fixed-timestamp ZIP and provenance, public mode requires clean committed source.
voice_component now validates manifest/native SHA and rejects candidate/noncommit
metadata on normal public path; allow_candidate only explicit development flag.
Current voice-candidate.zip59,821,840 bytes SHAae6d7499e46373d57a553d13550bd88cec058d07a84a1771e526d229b0266276
includes lazy binary, candidate metadata. Local FUTURE myVoice lock pin updated;
still MUST NOT push/commit until actual public archive exists and digest verified.
Suite candidate rebuild session87285 running with latest optional fix and newapp.
After complete run upgrade-acceptance.py --resume: existing pristine public110
fixture C:/Projects/.cache/my-voice-20261102/upgrade-1793668698752/Private,
programs tooling/.../upgrade-programs-1793668698752, origin localhost40020.
Script now supports resume; no owner fixtures. It will test protected110→111,
all old payload/identity/path retention, independent backup files, rollback,
model/project retention and reapply. Prior failure was before mutation; root110.
Then use normal Voice-only candidate update on the existing managed111 fixture to
exercise independent app update and lazy nested runtime, rerun managed acceptance.
Final public-source/channel/owner deployment work remains unchanged/pending.
Primary inspected110/MyAI20/35apps/noVoice, completed journal; secondary same110,
MyAI20, pre-existing Meet review warning. No owner deployment/model consent yet.


## Recovery reapply bug fixed before publication

Fresh managed test after lazy Voice-only update passes again, including MOSS and
Drive (the harness now binds the exact POST-created job ID; reading latest history
raced a prior MOSS result, so the earlier export mismatch was a test bug).

Actual protected110→111 upgrade and rollback passed, but reapply revealed Voice
failed while the updater still reported portal ready. Rollback retained models/
projects yet removed new app.json/DB, leaving a non-empty folder which apphost
correctly refused to adopt. Do not bypass that guard or patch markers manually.
Source now derives exclusively new private roots from the two verified recovery
snapshots and preserves the complete root only when absent from the old catalog/
snapshot and unshared with old apps. Existing app schema recovery is unchanged.
Regression tests preserve new Voice marker/DB/projects, still clear old metadata,
and reject preservation of pre-existing/snapshot-backed roots. Added explicit
Voice /healthz readiness to update restart (like Tickets/Forms), so this selected
managed app cannot fail silently behind a healthy portal. All suite/distribution/
maintenance/catalog/branding tests pass. No owner install affected.

Old failed upgrade fixture upgrade-1793668698752 is stopped and intentionally not
reused/repaired. New candidate rebuild+fresh full110 setup/upgrade/rollback/reapply
runs in exec session56532, logs suite-candidate-build.log then upgrade-*.log;
upgrade-acceptance.py without --resume creates a new synthetic root and overwrites
upgrade-process.json. Await it. App bytes remain exact0913a566...; only suite code
changed. Re-run managed smoke only if resulting code changes justify it; current
app-only proof and managed MOSS/Drive are green. Still no public repo/push/release
or owner Voice installs. Suite public111 remains absent, main e465a8a unchanged.


Managed candidate upgrade/rollback/reapply now fully passes on a fresh native110 fixture. All old app payloads/identity/paths and new Voice private state are retained. New app marker/database preservation and explicit Voice readiness are verified. Final app remains0913a566...; no further app runtime code changes. Publication/owner installs pending. Full suite tests/vet and publisher regression underway.

Public My Voice2 source c07ace5 and13 immutable assets verified, anonymous ZIP digest ccee56059037e06298d302cca8487961825cda0df9865efcab7b31c46f43fdf5. Native EXE e66d61720002393890a8ab46273919a04cb95dbf716f217f88ae84f6a23b4189. Adds full Pocket Cargo.lock notices/MPL corresponding sources, FFmpeg/LAME sources and fixed codec ZIP. Runtime unchanged. Suite pin now public2, normal no-candidate rebuild underway. App channel regenerated through standard publisher. Source/required signed Android111 publication and both owner installs remain pending. Preserve MyAI20/Hosting2 on both110 installations; owner data never fixture.

## Published111 and primary complete; secondary repair in progress

My Voice2 public c07ace5/13 assets and Workspace111 source82adff5/442 assets are immutable and verified. Required signed Android12 APK and anonymous ordinary channel pass; channel main cb1da2d. Final normal public-pin build has36 apps/429 packages, candidate:false. Exact final fresh111 SSO/390px/global logout, omission and public110→111 protected update/rollback/reapply all pass. Source/catalog/archive release notices match. Synthetic NTFS fixtures stopped and safely removed; evidence stays outside repo on I.

Primary normal new111 installer --update --apply --apps workspace,voice completed. Voice2 EXE e66d61720002393890a8ab46273919a04cb95dbf716f217f88ae84f6a23b4189, all116 owned payloads and served JS/CSS/logo match tested public bytes;35 services running/no failures. All old app/package contracts/bytes, identity/password fields, old decrypted secret entries and locations retained; MyAI20/Hosting2 retained. Full recovery manifest/every file verified, newest kept; normal cleanup retired1 eligible older copy (~53.1MB). Public apphost bootstrap is intentionally non-sensitive metadata; private voices/history/settings deny anonymous access. Primary browser required normal login, no owner authenticated feature fixture performed.

Secondary owner Updates normal110 integration guard required verified installer repair. Clicked Back up and reinstall once; installer1.3GB downloaded and verified, new process started. Old page reports stage4/check compatibility then connection lost while controller/tunnel stopped. Latest public /healthz still Cloudflare1033 at03:29UTC; no duplicate action submitted. Wait for supported repair to reconnect, verify111 and preserved versions, reload updated UI, check Voice optional row starts unchecked, explicitly choose only Voice, apply/verify completion/recovery/35 healthy services/served Voice2 UI, screenshot. Do not claim secondary complete or public filesystem audit. Do not bypass recovery or edit catalog/identity markers.

CUA Chrome3: voiceRolloutTab585734847 secondary/updates; voiceSecondaryHealthTab585734852 health check. Baseline34 table text rows saved privately in task artifacts. Original task-modified HF tab restored to original model tree; user tabs untouched. Primary task login tab closed. No owner model downloads/license clicks/audio created. Separate explicit first-use models remain. Mandatory publisher finished in session66028; primary delivery proof/session58149 completed. Remaining final receipts, history/public delivery docs, source-only handoff pushes, secondary verification and task tab cleanup pending. Source release tags/assets must stay unchanged.

## Secondary repair succeeded;112 fixes actual discovery gate

Secondary eventually reconnected after~27min verified repair;111 and34 services healthy, old app versions retained. Reloaded111 UI then actual public Check found no Voice row. Root cause: CheckUpdates outer included-group gates still used newDefaultIDs, skipping optional groups before markNewApps. Earlier unit helper/direct-bundle tests did not exercise this filter. Added full public-index CheckUpdates regression (same suite version, Accounts dependency, explicit Voice selection and explicit exclusion). Reproduced failure on111 (choice nil), fixed one shared includedGroups plan from markNewApps for progress and iteration; all distribution/maintenance/suite/catalog tests and distribution vet pass. No app bytes/data/integration changes. Building112 through normal pins; Android12 source unchanged, mandatory signed companion rebuilt with new release provenance.111 immutable release retained. Primary111/Voice2 complete; no need to change its working controller. Secondary111 needs normal small Workspace112 update, then optional Voice-only UI install; another repair is unnecessary. Native isolated112 actual UI discovery/public-package install acceptance pending before publication.

## Final delivery — complete on both PCs

My Voice2 source c07ace5,13 immutable assets and anonymous ZIP/EXE/source/codec
checks pass. Exact native EXE SHA256 is
e66d61720002393890a8ab46273919a04cb95dbf716f217f88ae84f6a23b4189.
Workspace112 source33aaa79/442 assets, signed Android12 and ordinary public
channel436758f are verified.111 and source-only app1 tags/assets remain intact.
No GitHub Actions/VM/WSL/hosted builds. Runtime/model pins are unchanged by112.

Delivery caught111's outer discovery gate hiding optional groups before its
correct selection helper ran.112 fixes that gate, with a full CheckUpdates
public-index red/green regression and native110 setup→111 repair→112 ordinary
update→unchecked optional Voice→Voice-only install acceptance. All relevant Go
checks/vet pass; every pre-existing fixture app/manager byte is retained. The
initial fresh111 harness intentionally had a Voice setup opt-out and correctly
hid it; its timeout was a fixture assumption, not a remaining discovery defect.

Primary: normal protected111 + Voice2 complete. All116 owned payloads and served
JS/CSS/logo match public/tested bytes;35 native services running/no failures.
All35 old app contracts/payloads, old decrypted secret entries, identity/password
fields and installation locations retained; MyAI20/Hosting2 unchanged. Independently
verified19124 recovery files and manifest; newest recovery retained, normal cleanup
retired1 older eligible copy (~53.1MB). Primary authenticated browser required a
normal sign-in, so no authenticated owner browser acceptance is claimed there;
local version/managed OIDC metadata and anonymous private API denial pass.

Secondary: supported owner Updates110→111 repair completed, followed by normal
17.7MB Workspace-only112 update. Corrected UI offered Voice UNCHECKED; selected
only Voice2 (73.6MB/116 files). All9 native stages/backup/startup/cleanup complete
in13m35s.35 services healthy including Voice; fresh check reports Voice2 and112
Up to date. All32 other displayed groups/versions retained, including MyAI20 and
Hosting2. Existing MyMeet review warning predates this task. Actual MyAccounts
session opens Voice home, renders2, expected index-en0bbr1A.js/index-CljoH0WX.css,
and shared Apps picker includes Voice in Creative & Development. Latest verified
recovery update-20261103T043541-ff73f589a0fe kept; normal cleanup retired1 eligible
older copy (~292.2MB). No independent remote filesystem/credential audit claimed.

Combined sanitised receipts: app docs/delivery-preview2.json and Workspace
 docs/my-voice-delivery.json. Owner screenshots stay private; source screenshots
use synthetic accounts. No owner audio, references, model-download acknowledgements
or functional fixtures were created. Models remain explicit first-use Settings
downloads per PC. MOSS cloning and ungated Pocket presets need no HF login; no
blind quality-superiority or non-English/old-laptop/physical-phone/reboot/clean-host
claim. Native CPU/WAV/MP3/clone/Drive/queue/recovery and390px acceptance are recorded
in the report/receipts. All task NTFS fixtures and idle test controllers removed;
owner data/recovery and other apps retained. Completed updater/task verification
tabs closed; live secondary Voice tab left as deliverable. Nothing remains for
this managed app delivery; immutable release assets and code tags stay unchanged.

## Preview3 worker repair channel in progress

User reports PC2 Pocket18/Alba generic worker failure after first-use download.
No private log/status was provided yet, so the production root cause remains
unconfirmed. Public2 short speech reproductions pass on this AVX2 host. Official
Pocket targets x86-64-v3; app3 adds a native baseline x86-64/static CRT fallback
only for STATUS_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION and safe actionable status errors. Model and
integration7 contracts/formats unchanged. Complete app handoff in its repository.

Public app3 source02851da74be82f3ea289074a9b83d412474ccd1f /14 immutable assets
verified; anonymous ZIP SHA9516d4f43e9edd3753afe033bd90d357759e349a433f4d1f39fd30fa0f067591,
EXE67f8aebe04f60dce52e48373844b8effbee9c9466b827865eec673b644e2adbf.
Both Pocket model WAV/MP3, native Windows exception/fallback/privacy, real portable
restricted-worker speech, Go tests/vet, production UI and offline Rust recipe
pass. All old runtime bytes unchanged; only portable worker added. All116 package
IDs/destinations match111/112 contract. No suite release/Android rebuild is needed
for this independent app repair; future component pin advances to3.

Artifacts I:/Projects/tooling/my-voice-worker-fix-20261103; synthetic NTFS root
C:/Projects/.cache/my-voice-worker-fix-20261103. Actual public112 setup with
Accounts+Voice2 is running localhost39820; baseline MyAccounts/Voice and genuine
nested Pocket generation pass. Needs normal public-channel Voice3 update,
retention/recovery/rollback/reapply/post-update generation before owner rollout.
Track managed-process.json, then stop task services and clean disposable C data.
Native3 standalone is already stopped. Never create owner feature fixtures.

Next: inspect/push refreshed public channel (retain all old rows/withholdings),
anonymous normal check, synthetic app-only protected update gates, primary111
and PC2/112 app-only updates through supported paths. Primary data C:/tmp/workspace/
Private, PC2 remote I:/Workspace/Private. Preserve manager/unselected apps/identity/
credentials/paths/model/audio/recovery. Retry the user's existing PC2 failed job
as intended recovery after tested rollout, without adding fake owner QA speech.
Capture real outcome/status, keep failed recovery explicit if unresolved. Public
old tags/assets and original delivery receipts remain immutable. No Actions,
subagents, VM/WSL/container or owner feature-fixture use.

## Preview3 repair — completed on both PCs

App3 source02851da /14 immutable assets and anonymous package/EXE/portable/source
checks pass. Channel377e861 promotes only one new Voice row, retaining every old
release/repository/withholding; future component pin3. SDK/integration7 unchanged,
so no suite release or Android rebuild. Public old assets/tags remain untouched.

Additional native outer-Job test runs the real portable worker and exception/
privacy tests inside another restricted Job Object; passes. Actual public112
managed setup→normal channel Voice2→3→rollback2→reapply3 passes; all116 owned
payloads exact, manager/Accounts bytes, identities/paths, pinned models/projects/
audio retained, all21 recorded recovery files independently verified. Reapplied
MyAccounts/proxy speech creates fresh1.437s audible WAV/MP3. Full receipts are in
 docs/delivery-preview3.json; prior2 receipt stays historical and unmodified.

Primary normal Voice-only update completed on Workspace111, which was retained.
All116 installed payloads and served JS/CSS match tested/public3;35 services healthy.
Every unselected app/package contract and byte, existing identity/password fields,
old decrypted secret entries and locations retained. Recovery/cleanup complete,
new verified app recovery update-20261103T144832-e8fe39df927e retained; normal cleanup
retired1 eligible older copy. No owner model/audio QA generation was created there.

PC2 normal Voice-only update completed all9 stages in9m55s, Workspace112 retained.
Fresh check reports3 Up to date. All33 other displayed groups/versions unchanged
(including MyAI20/Hosting2); pre-existing MyMeet review warning remains.35 services
healthy, actual MyAccounts session and installed Pocket18 retained. New verified
recovery update-20261103T144746-532090950f19 retained; normal cleanup retired1
eligible old copy. No independent remote filesystem/credential audit is claimed.

Retried the USER'S EXISTING failed recording without changing its text, voice,
model or controls. It now completes:1.5s audio,7.7s generation, waveform/player and
WAV/MP3 links available. No new fake owner QA recording, licence acknowledgement,
model download or audio export performed. Media/screenshots stay private. The
original OS status/log was not supplied, so do not claim a confirmed CPU cause;
compatibility fallback/error reporting are implemented and actual recovery is
observed. User should refresh an older phone tab to see the recovered result.

Cleanup: stop the task managed39820 installation, verify tracked child processes
have exited, then remove only C:/Projects/.cache/my-voice-worker-fix-20261103 after
resolved-path/reparse/process checks. Preserve I tooling evidence/public artifacts,
owner installations, credentials and newest usable recovery. Final source/docs
push and task-tab cleanup follow; do not move release3 or replace assets.

Final cleanup completed: signed out of the synthetic session, stopped its managed
controller/children, verified no task process references and removed only the
named disposable NTFS root. Rust task-local proxy symlinks were checked to target
its own rustup.exe and removed as links before recursion. This fixture cleanup did not touch owner data or recovery. The updater's
ordinary retirement of eligible older copies is recorded above; no global PATH
change was made. I tooling/public evidence is retained. Private
PC2 recovered-speech screenshot remains outside Git; live recovered owner page
is the deliverable. No further repair or target remains pending.

## Preview4 full-script repair — publication checkpoint

App source2c6f6f7 is pushed; immutable v0.1.0-preview.4 has14 verified public
assets. EXE SHA5f70ec07ca6d71dee84bc584283a97097cbf9a1c5dd0f953188f5a63bc26c25e;
ZIP SHA2dc243844a067c030a219393c5ba8c0688906ccb0bb3a7c1bb9ea594e641d6b0.
The editor now sends complete canonical text independently of details visibility,
keeps previews separate, and collapses details by default. Actual15-chunk75.320s
WAV includes every chunk and MP3; frontend6 regressions, Go tests/vet and build pass.
Runtime/schema/116 owned packages/integration7 unchanged; app-only promotion needs
no new suite/Android release. Channel adds only Voice4 while preserving every
existing row/withholding; ordinary component pin4. Protected managed update and
primary113 delivery follow. User explicitly deferred PC2 until its model benchmark
finishes; latest other-chat final reports interrupted run/fresh run pending, so no
PC2 restart is authorized yet. Full artifact/progress handoff is in app history.

## Preview4 managed acceptance and primary delivery complete

Channel4a7445c / app source2c6f6f7 /14 immutable public4 assets verify anonymously.
Ordinary component projection consumes116 exact public files; catalog/distribution
tests pass. Actual public112 setup→normal channel Voice2→4 with verified current
public113 installer retains manager112/Accounts, identities/paths/models/projects/
audio, all116 payloads and22 recovery files. Old112 installer correctly required
new113 reader for the current integration8 catalog and made no changes. Fresh
MyAccounts/proxy UI speech is7.792s with all3 chunks and MP3; details collapsed.

Primary app-only protected Voice4 update retains Workspace113 and every unrelated
app/package contract/byte, account/password fields, existing secret contents and
locations.36 services healthy; served production JS/CSS and116 payloads exact.
Actual MyAccounts/proxy editor4 opens with Show segment details collapsed. Recovery
verified and retained; normal cleanup retired1 eligible older copy. No owner
feature fixture/model/audio was created. Synthetic sessions/controllers stopped;
only the guarded disposable task NTFS root removed, tooling evidence retained.

PC2 is explicitly deferred at the user's reaffirmed request: finish its model
benchmark first. Latest benchmark chat ended with interrupted run/fresh run pending.
No Voice4 apply/restart submitted there; do not claim both targets complete. Resume
only after benchmark completion or explicit reprioritization, inspect current
operations/versions, then use normal Voice-only update and verify health/SSO/retention.

PC2 remains EXPLICITLY DEFERRED at the user's reaffirmed benchmark-first request.
No Voice5 apply/restart there. Resume only after benchmark completion or user
reprioritization; inspect current installed/public versions and active operations,
then normal Voice-only update, retention/recovery/health/SSO verification. Do not
claim both targets complete. All other implementation/publication/delivery work
is finished; preserve existing owner recording tabs when resuming.

## Preview6 public delivery and both targets verified

Source9b316127 / immutable v0.1.0-preview.6 has14 verified public assets; anonymous
ZIP/EXE/runtime/source and main update channel verify. Channel/pin5491f42 adds
only Voice6 while preserving all prior releases, unrelated rows and withholdings.

A short GitHub raw-main cache lag safely yielded no available update/no mutation;
normal channel delivery proceeded after propagation. Ordinary component116 exact
files and catalog/distribution checks pass. No new suite/Android release/Actions.

Actual public114 setup Voice5 to6 through public114 updater retains manager,
Accounts, identity/paths/models/projects/audio;116 public payloads and17 recovery
files independently verify. Managed MyAccounts/proxy UI prepares the same failed
26s quiet stereo CC0 reference into6.38s mono24kHz, retaining original bytes and
showing both players/summary. Real cloned speech completes7.5906s with both script
segments and WAV/MP3. Pre-update clone and6.7s recording retained.

Primary Voice-only5 to6 retains Workspace114 and every unselected app/package
contract/byte, identities/password fields, existing secret contents and locations.
116 files/production JS B2P2Ca8p/CSS DQnFYA9P match;36 services healthy. Recovery
independently verified and kept; ordinary cleanup retired1 eligible older copy.
Large recovery cleanup was still making read progress before finishing normally.
Actual SSO/proxy UI6 exposes automatic prep and inline install/capture guards.
No owner feature fixture/model download was created.

User explicitly reprioritized PC2, lifting the prior deferral FOR THIS REPAIR.
Normal Voice-only5 to6 update submitted ONCE; all9 stages complete in242s, verified
recovery retained and1 eligible older copy retired. Workspace113 and every other
installed version retained;36 services running; actual SSO/proxy UI6 and retained
MOSS ready. Verification there is remote UI/health, not independent filesystem
hash auditing. Do not claim an owner-reference retry: old page required sign-in,
user restored it and the old file selection was cleared. Agent never navigated/
reloaded that original tab. New6 cloning page is ready for the same file; user was
asked to reselect. Browser control then required an extension update. No fresh
recording is required, but that user's specific audio recovery is not verified.

Both synthetic sessions signed out; tracked services stopped; no active process
references/reparse points remained; only the guarded disposable NTFS task root
was removed. Tooling/evidence retained; owner data/recovery not manually removed.
Full privacy-filtered receipt: my-voice repository docs/delivery-preview6.json. All repair, public
promotion and both-PC delivery gates complete; only optional owner-file retry
requires reselect/browser access. No release asset/tag replacement.

## Preview7 public and both-PC delivery complete

Sourcec3fc8782 / immutable v0.1.0-preview.7 has14 verified assets and anonymous
ZIP/EXE/runtime/source downloads. Scoped pin/channel9482f59 preserves all other

Raw-main cache lag was awaited without installing the old version or bypassing
normal discovery. No new suite/Android release; no Actions or replaced assets.

Actual public114 managed Voice5 to7 normal update preserves manager/unselected
bytes, accounts/paths, models/audio and saved voice/recording/script database
rows.116 payloads and17 recovery files independently verify. Actual SSO/proxy UI
selects the retained clone directly from Alba, switches MOSS/title and generates
complete2-segment8.0388s WAV/MP3, with correct recording speaker and playable media.
Native exact7 acceptance is8.6788s;18 frontend regressions, Go tests/vet and build,
desktop/phone review pass. All fixtures use isolated synthetic CC0 data.

identity/password fields, secret contents and paths.116 files and served production
JS tHBeFQCq/CSS DQnFYA9P match;36 services healthy; recovery independently checked/
kept; ordinary cleanup retires1 eligible older copy. Actual SSO/proxy7 dropdown
shows voices across engines. No owner generation or model download fixture.

PC2 normal Voice-only6 to7 submitted once, all9 stages complete in190s; recovery
verified/retained and1 eligible older copy retired. Workspace113 and every other
installed version retained;36 services healthy; actual SSO/proxy UI7. Existing
saved clone now exists and remains selected/ready; no further capture is needed
for this request. Original owner page never navigated/reloaded. A new7 page fixes
the actual stale automatic title while preserving script, clone ID, model,
language, speed, pitch, volume and pause (private before/after DOM comparison).
Dropdown includes the clone and both presets. No owner speech was generated.
Remote evidence is normal updater UI/health/version rows, not an independent
remote filesystem hash audit. New verified owner7 page is left as deliverable.

Both synthetic UI sessions signed out and task services stopped; resolved-path,
active-process and reparse checks passed before removing only the named disposable
NTFS root. Tooling/evidence retained; owner data/recovery not manually removed.
All source, public promotion and both target delivery gates complete; no pending
PC2 deferral or implementation work. Receipt: my-voice repository docs/delivery-preview7.json.
