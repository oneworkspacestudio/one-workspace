# One Authenticator delivered: 30 October 2026

The implemented preview is pushed, published and installed on the current
Windows PC through the protected paired Workspace updater.

- [One Authenticator v0.1.0-preview.2](https://github.com/oneworkspacestudio/one-authenticator/releases/tag/v0.1.0-preview.2): source `358673711d43c63688a450be0c72e7e6a755b30d`.
- [MyAccounts preview-20261030.1](https://github.com/oneworkspacestudio/myaccounts/releases/tag/preview-20261030.1): source `926137b8ab374bfe47c8efc14352071da5d8c865`.
- [Workspace v0.3.0-preview.109](https://github.com/oneworkspacestudio/one-workspace/releases/tag/v0.3.0-preview.109): source `2da2fe88c5bd7739d2d8e6a09c63cdc76bd6f074`.

The mandatory local publisher verified all 343 immutable release assets and
permanently signed Android companion 0.1.0-preview.11, including package/version,
source provenance and certificate. The public update channel was promoted in
`c0801b6`; anonymous APK and Windows download checks passed. A fresh default-online
setup discovered 35 apps with Authenticator selected under Administration.
GitHub Actions remained disabled. Existing published assets were not replaced.

## Actual managed acceptance

Synthetic isolated NTFS accounts/data passed fresh setup, encrypted offline PWA
codes with the host stopped, real password then TOTP SSO to Drive/Docs/Photos,
old hub-session rejection after MFA activation, protected 108-to-109 upgrade,
identity/selection/file preservation, old-controller rejection, rollback and
clean reapplication with original-password SSO. Adversarial native provider tests
cover pending enrollment, replay/concurrency, recovery consumption/regeneration,
cross-flow limits, token/refresh invalidation and encrypted backup/restore.
Phone-context QR/manual camera cleanup and service-worker 1-to-2 vault preservation
also passed. The final Remote8 rebuild preserved all tested non-Remote packages
and contracts exactly; final inventory was checked separately.

## Current Windows PC

The supported updater applied manager109, MyAccounts preview-20261030.1 and
Authenticator preview2 with a verified recovery manifest. Operational invariants
confirmed unchanged existing identity/password records, secret values, signing
keys, owner configuration and all unselected package contracts/bytes. Both paired
services and the public Authenticator health endpoint passed. All 34 reported process services were running; no service failures were reported.
An earlier Cinema failure observed during discovery was absent at both deployment
baseline and completion; this task does not claim to have repaired Cinema.
Owner data was never used as a test fixture. No other PC installation is claimed.

Installation does not enroll a phone or enable MFA on an existing account.
Open OneAccount MFA settings, enroll the independent phone and save ten recovery
codes separately. The current server schema supports one active authenticator
seed per account; additional independent devices are unavailable in this preview.
Security notifications are durable account-settings events; email/push transport
and automated lost-all-factors recovery are unavailable. See the security model
for the supervised recovery policy and five-minute recent-authentication rules.

Physical Android Chrome/iPhone Safari, real camera hardware, reboot/service and
clean-host acceptance remain unverified. Browser checks do not constitute a
production security certification.

Sanitized receipts: `docs/evidence/one-authenticator109/`.
